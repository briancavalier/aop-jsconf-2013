* [Even more DOM support](docs/dom.md), including DOM event connections via wire/on and cloning DOM elements.
* [Functions are first-class citizens](docs/functions.md) that can be used in very powerful ways.
* [Transform connections](docs/connections.md#transform-connections) use functions to transform data as it flows through connections (including DOM event connections).
* Built on latest [cujo.js](http://cujojs.com) platform:
	* [curl](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) >= 0.7.1, or 0.6.8

* Improved debugging with `wire/debug`

## 0.7.6

* New `waitParent` option for the [wire factory](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/Factories).  When set to `true`, it guarantees a child context will not even start wiring until the encompassing parent has completed.

* Fix for all known instances where wire would not notice errors that happen during wiring.
* Baby steps toward Node compatibility for the wire.js core.  *We're currently targetting v0.8.0 as the first Node-compatible version*.
* Update to [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when) v0.10.3
* Update to [aop.js](https://github.com/cujojs/aop) v0.5.0

## 0.7.3

* Improved logging in `wire/debug`, now with stack traces, and guards against missing `console` in IE.
* Guard against null when scanning plugins
* Update to [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when) v0.9.4

## 0.7.0

* New [wire factory](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/Factories) (aka wire inception!) that allows wiring chains of other specs, or injecting functions for deferred wiring.  [See the docs](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/Factories)
* [wire/dojo/dijit](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-dojo-dijit) plugin:
    * `placeAt` feature that allows easier placement of Dijit widgets.
    * supports easy dijit theming via its `theme` option
* New [wire/dojo/data](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-dojo-data) plugin that supports legacy `dojo/data` datastores
* [wire/dom](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-dom) plugin now supports options for adding/removing classes to `<html>` during wiring.
* Now using [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when) v0.9.3 for promises and async handling.  See also the Deprecated Functionality below.
* The wire.js core is now **only 2.5k** with Google Closure + gzip!
* **Limited support** for using wire in a non-AMD setup.  This is intended to aid in transitioning to AMD and CommonJS modules, and *it's unlikely that wire's full functionality will ever be extended to cover non-AMD/CommonJS environments.*
	* wire.js can now create components using raw constructors in addition to AMD module ids.  This allows wire.js to create components instances from libraries that haven't yet fully committed to AMD or CommonJS.
* **Deprecated functionality** - to be removed in v0.8.0
    * Injecting a reference to the [full current context](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/Contexts) via `{ $ref: 'wire!context' }`
    	* The components in the current context will always be in an incomplete state, and relying on this is potentially dangerous.
    	* I may consider allowing injecting a *promise* for the current context, which would resolve after the current context has finished wiring.
    	* If you were using the `wire()` method of a context injected via `{ $ref: 'wire!context' }`, you can use `{ $ref: 'wire!' }` instead, which provides a direct reference to the `wire()` method itself--i.e. it injects a *function* that works just like `context.wire()`.
	* Many plugin methods received a `wire` parameter that had several promise helper methods, such as `wire.when`, `wire.whenAll`, etc.  These are deprecated in favor of simply using [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when) instead, which is provided as a submodule in the support dir.

## 0.6.0

* [wire/aop](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-aop) plugin: AOP weaving with pointcuts, and before, after, afterReturning, afterThrowing, after (aka "afterFinally") advice using [aop.js](https://github.com/cujojs/aop)
* Experimental optimizer/build tool support for [cram](https://github.com/unscriptable/cram). Point cram at your wire spec and let it optimize your entire app! *Docs coming soon*
* [wire/debug](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-debug) plugin: tracks components and tells you which ones couldn't be wired and why
* Improved memory management, especially when destroying contexts.
* **Breaking Changes**
    * The plugin format has changed to support new, more powerful async plugins.  See the [Plugin format wiki](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/Plugin-format) for more information
    * [wire/aop](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-aop) decorator and introduction options have changed.  See the [wire/aop wiki](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-aop) for more information

## 0.5.2

* Fix for [wire/sizzle](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-aop) plugin
* Updated to work with [curl v0.5](https://github.com/unscriptable/curl) domReady.
* **NOTE** wire.js v0.5.2 now requires curl.js 0.5 or later.  It will also work with any recent version of RequireJS, and with dojo 1.6 or later.

## 0.5.1

* `create` factory now supports the `isConstructor` option, when `true`, forces an object instance to be created using `new`.
* Improved debug output when using [wire/debug](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-debug) plugin,
* Slimmed down [wire/aop](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-aop) plugin in preparation for a new version in an upcoming release,
* Automated unit tests using [Dojo DOH](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/util/doh.html), 
* Semantic versioning

## 0.5

* Re-engineered core: smaller, faster, and more loader-independent,
* Can be used as either an AMD module or an AMD plugin,
* Tested with [curl.js](https://github.com/unscriptable/curl), and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/).  Should also work with the upcoming [dojo 1.7 loader](http://dojotoolkit.org/) (but hasn't been tested yet),
* Improved plugin system,
* AOP plugin, [wire/aop](https://github.com/cujojs/wire/wiki/wire-aop): Decorators and Introductions.  *Coming Soon*: before, after, afterReturning, afterThrowing, and around advice,
* Prototype factory plugin allows using the JS prototype chain to create new objects directly from other objects in your wire spec.
* Sizzle plugin, `wire/sizzle`, courtesy of [@unscriptable](https://twitter.com/unscriptable)
* Not entirely new to 0.5, but worth mentioning Dojo integration, including:
	* pubsub connector, subscribe *and publish* non-invasively using `dojo.publish/subscribe`
	* event connector that uses dojo.connect
	* easy JsonRest datastores via `resource!` reference resolver
	* `dom.query!` reference resolver that uses `dojo.query`
